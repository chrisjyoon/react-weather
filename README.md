# This is my first React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I had to run with https mode to use `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`
